# trio Game

This repo holds my experiments playing with the [trio game](https://www.ravensburger.de/spielanleitungen/ecm/Spielanleitungen/Trio.pdf).

trio.py searches for puzzles with solutions for as many as possible results.

index.html visualises a random choosen puzzle.

There are presets with solutions for 1 to 90 and presets with at least 3 solutions for 1 to 30.
